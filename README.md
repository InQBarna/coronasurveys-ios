# CoronaSurveys iOS

The CoronaSurveys project is a collaborative endeavour from several universities and research institutions (team members) Data about COVID-19 cases is collected via anonymous open surveys (all the data collected is openly available). The results below present estimations on the incidence and evolution of COVID-19 obtained from this data using the Network Scale-up Method. You can help by regularly completing the anonymous survey.
