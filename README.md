# CoronaSurveys iOS

## The Project
The CoronaSurveys project is a collaborative endeavour from several universities and research institutions ([team members](https://coronasurveys.org/team/)) Data about COVID-19 cases is collected via anonymous open surveys (all the data collected is openly available). The results present estimations on the incidence and evolution of COVID-19 obtained from this data using the Network Scale-up Method. You can help by regularly completing the anonymous survey.

All the info for the project can be found [here](https://coronasurveys.org/)
