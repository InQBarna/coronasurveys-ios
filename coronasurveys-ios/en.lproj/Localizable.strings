"about_project_text"="The world is suffering from a pandemic called COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. When testing availability and other resources are limited, national and local governments can encounter problems evaluating the reach and evolution of the epidemic. Hence, any means to evaluate the evolution of the pandemic and its impact with reasonable level of accuracy is useful.\nThe objective of this study is the collection and publication of data concerning the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries. This data is useful to estimate multiple parameters of the pandemic and their evolution in a simple, cheap, and homogeneous way across countries, in combination with other data sources. These numbers are, for instance, the number of infected persons with the COVID-19 virus, the number of fatalities, the number of people vaccinated, etc. They are estimated at a given point in time in each country, and their evolution over time, using techniques like the Network Scale-up Method.";

No personal information is collected nor stored in these surveys. Because each of us can provide information about the situation among our direct contacts, in aggregate we are able to get rough estimates of total cases, new cases, fatalities, vaccination levels, etc.\nBecause we are tracking the evolution of this epidemic over time, once you have completed the survey, please remember to come back and update the survey at least once a week, or when the responses change.\nFinally, you can help us by asking your friends, colleagues and relatives to complete the survey as well! Thank you!";
